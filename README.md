# Black-Friday-Prediction
Black Friday is seen as the start of the holiday shopping season. In this project we aim to analyze customer behaviour by identifying/understanding important factors and predicting sales making use of big data analytics tools and techniques. This project highlights the dependency of sales on various parameter viz. Age group, City, Product Categories, Gender, Marital status, etc. Our main objective was to find some useful insight from the data related to customer behavior. Through extensive research and exploratory analysis, three machine learning models - Linear Regression, KNN Regression and Decision Tree Regression were built and tuned to predict sales on this very busy shopping day. These models were then evaluated on the basis of performance metrics to find the most suitable model. Along with statistical results and model analysis, depicting the results using visualizations helped us emphasise on our results. Stores that participate in future black friday sales can use this analysis and prediction model to understand their customers better, decide the placement of products in their stores, develop various marketing strategies, segment their customers on the basis of factors such as age group, marital status, geographical location, etc. to gain profits and improve their performance as compared to their competitors.
